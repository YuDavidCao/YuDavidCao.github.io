First of all, finding a programming language to learn is already a difficult choice as there are countless languages with uses. Some of the more beginner-friendly languages are Python or Javascript, but the initial language choice doesn't matter much because all of the popular languages share the same concepts like variables, loops, and functions. The important thing is to fully understand the concepts and be able to utilize them in problem-solving."}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"If you have a teacher, tutor, or mentor, that is perfect as they can help you understand the concepts and give you advice for learning.

But, take it from me: No matter which course you end up choosing, stick to the end so that you don't miss anything because a solid foundation is integral.

True learning happens when you apply all the knowledge you learned from the tutorial and make a similar, but not the same project.
