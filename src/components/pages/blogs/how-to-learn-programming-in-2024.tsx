            It has never been easier to learn programming than it is in 2024.
            However, it's also never been harder. With AI and technology in
            general continuing to improve, programming tutorials and courses
            have flooded the internet, making accessing this information easier
            than ever. At the same time, however, it's easy to get overwhelmed
            with the massive amount of information and to have no idea where to
            start. In this article, I will share my advice based on my personal
            experience on how to learn programming in 2024.
          </p>
          <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 tracking-tight">
            Getting started
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            No matter what you are trying to do, the first step is always the
            hardest; this applies to programming as well. First of all, finding
            a programming language to learn is already a difficult choice as
            there are countless languages with uses. Some of the more
            beginner-friendly languages are Python or Javascript, but the
            initial language choice doesn't matter much because all of the
            popular languages share the same concepts like variables, loops, and
            functions. The important thing is to fully understand the concepts
            and be able to utilize them in problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you have a teacher, tutor, or mentor, that is perfect as they can
            help you understand the concepts and give you advice for learning.
            However, it is also totally fine to use the internet, which has
            countless courses, videos, and websites available. But, take it from
            me: No matter which course you end up choosing, stick to the end so
            that you don't miss anything because a solid foundation is integral.
            Meanwhile, don't hesitate to ask for help on places like Stack
            Overflow or other programming communities as they can provide
            valuable insights on your programming journey.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The initial process of learning can be boring or confusing, and that
            is where a peer can become invaluable. Having someone at a similar
            skill level to bounce ideas off, share resources with, and work
            through challenges with can make the learning journey much smoother
            and more enjoyable.
          </p>
          <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 tracking-tight">
            Project-based learning
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The best way to learn programming is through projects. With the
            basic programming concepts under your belt, diving into projects can
            significantly increase your problem-solving skills and satisfaction.
            Rather than simply memorizing syntax and algorithms, programming
            projects provide hands-on experience for applying the knowledge.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            After learning the basics, it's always a good idea to start with
            simple projects like a mini-game, a simple website, or any program
            that interests you. Personally, I find solving math problems with
            programming to be fascinating as sometimes Olympiad math problems
            can be trivial with the power of computers.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It is very convenient to watch tutorials on YouTube or other places
            to guide us through a project as they can help us learn and
            understand new concepts. However, they are useless if you don't
            implement them yourself. "Tutorial Hell" refers to a state where one
            keeps consuming tutorials without putting the acquired knowledge
            into practice. True learning happens when you apply all the
            knowledge you learned from the tutorial and make a similar, but not
            the same project. Usually, after one or two large projects with the
            help of tutorials, Google, Stack Overflow, and also generative AI, I
            begin to fully understand the languages, frameworks, and concepts.
          </p>
          <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 tracking-tight">
            Interest is key
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Interest is the biggest driving force in learning. In programming,
            finding an area that interests you is essential. In the programming
            field, there are countless related fields like web, backend, mobile,
            AI, etc. Maybe you find the web to be confusing but resonate
            strongly with AI, maybe you find mobile app development to be
            tedious but are fascinated by backend systems. Whatever it may be,
            finding your niche within the vast programming landscape can make
            the learning process more enjoyable and sustainable. Once you find
            your passion, follow a developer roadmap or simply pick a passion
            project and keep putting work into it.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Moreover, recording your work can be a massive motivating factor.
            Post your progress online or put it into your diary or planner can
            help you track your growth and accomplishments over time. Day by day
            you will begin to realize your accomplishments and growth.
            Additionally, sharing your work with others, whether through
            programming communities, open-source contributions, or collaboration
            on projects, can yield valuable feedback.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In a rapidly evolving industry like programming, learning is not
            just beneficial â€” it's essential. Languages, frameworks, and tools
            will always become obsolete one day, but the concepts, experiences,
            friends, and ways to learn will preserve and help you forever in
            your life, so start early, and learn continuously!
